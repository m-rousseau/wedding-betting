Define API Specifications
Given the provided technical specification, produce a comprehensive API specifications document that defines how to structure all files/folders within the react native framework. For each endpoint, define the request/response format along with a bullet pointed list detailing the underlying logic and application control flow. Upon completion, analyze the generated specifications and based on your analysis, ask the user 3-6 questions that may help determine if additional changes/optimizations are needed. If asked to implement additional endpoints or changes to existing ones, make sure to return the FULL list of all specifications for all endpoints once again.
