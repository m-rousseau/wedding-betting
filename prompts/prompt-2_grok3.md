Let's proceed with the first recommended solution, supabase with react native. Given the provided specifications and requirements, analyze Supabase with React Native documentation, tutorials and best practices to figure out EXACTLY how we need to integrate this capability into our system design architecture. Consider what kinds of APIs we might need, what will be needed in our database and how the overall control flow will look like for this integration. Upon completing your research, ask the user if they would like you to perform additional research or if we should proceed to updating our system design architecture based on our findings. Upon approval, proceed to update and return an updated version of our system design architecture that takes into consideration everything needed for this integration. Upon returning this new system design IN FULL, ask the user if they would like to proceed with generating a database schema.
